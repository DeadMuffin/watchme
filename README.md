<h1>Watchme</h1>
Watchme is a simple time tracking software with analytics. Everything is hosted on a local server in Docker, and the data is stored locally in MariaDB.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project is far from perfection, but it's a fun project for personal use, designed to help me learn new things and track my various projects. Despite the abundance of software options available, I tried to utilize frameworks and libraries I already knew and some that I wanted to learn.

The main goal is to store data about:

When I worked on which project?
How long did I work on each project?
What did I do during that time?


<h2>Features</h2>
<b>Project Management:</b> Easily create and manage your projects. <br>

<b>Time Tracking:</b> Add detailed time entries with comments for each project. <br>

<b>Stopwatch:</b> Use the built-in stopwatch to track your work in real-time. You can add the recorded time directly to a project. <br>

<b>Reminders:</b> Set up two timers to remind you to take breaks â€“ one for drinking and one for standing. Customize the timer durations in the settings. <br>

<b>Analytics:</b> Get insights into your work: <br>

<b>Pie Chart:</b> Visualize the distribution of time spent on each project. <br>

<b>Bar Chart:</b> Track daily work durations. Apply filters for specific projects and time periods. <br>

<b>Detailed Table:</b> View additional information about your work, including the date, duration, and comments. <br>

<b>Easy Deployment:</b> Deploy Watchme with a single command for hassle-free setup. <br>

<b>Bulk Import/Export:</b> Import new projects or time entries via API, and export your data conveniently. <br>

<h2>Installation and Getting Started</h2>
Requirements:

- Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your system.

- Download Configuration Files: Obtain the Dockerfile, Docker-compose.yml and init.sql from this repository. Store them in the location where you want to store your project data.

- Navigate to the Project Directory: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you've placed the configuration files and where you want the data to be stored.

- Start the Application: In the terminal, execute the command docker-compose up. This may take some time, but upon completion, a "data" folder will be created to store your database data.

- Access the Application: Open your web browser and visit "localhost:8000" to access the Watchme application. From there, you can start tracking your projects.


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
You only need Docker to run this project. The project uses several libraries and frameworks like Vue, Laravel, composer, npm, Vite, Axios, Chart.js, chartjs-plugin-zoom, vue-ctk-date-time-picker 
and vue-timer-hook, but Docker manages these dependencies, so you don't need to install them separately.

- After creating some projects, choose one from the dropdown and start the stopwatch to track time.
You can add comments about what you're doing while working. If you need a break, you can pause and continue later or reset the watch.
